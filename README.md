# RStudio Table Contest 2020 Submission

Our goals for the [2020 RStudio Table Contest](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/09/15/announcing-the-2020-rstudio-table-contest/) was to learn and practice with the [gt package](https://gt.rstudio.com/). To do so we decided to focus on the following aspects: 
-	Include interactive figures within the table. For this, we chose the [echarts4r package](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/) to create interactive graphics with Echarts Javascripts, albeit other packages would have also worked (ie. Plotly, highcharter, etc.)
-	Include images, either thought a [GitHub](https://github.com/HatScripts/circle-flags) repo (flags) or Wikimedia commons scraping (maps)
-	Include as many HTML tricks as necessary to improve the overall readability of the table (for example HTML color of headers, icons, spanners, hyperlinks, currency symbols, etc.)
-	Include footnotes, in particular a footnote color legend for the color column, an HTML details tab to display in an inconspicuous way the R session information and font awesome icons for github and twitter hyperlinks).  

In short the Big Mac Index, is published by [The Economist]( https://www.economist.com/) as an informal way of measuring the purchasing power parity (PPP) between two currencies and provides a test of the extent to which market exchange rates result in goods costing the same in different countries. It seeks to make exchange-rate theory a bit more digestible.
